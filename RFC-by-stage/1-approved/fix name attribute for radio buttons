# Fix name attribute for radio buttons in 'Accessibility' tab

## The issue to be solved

  Here https://gold.designsystemau.org/components/control-input/accessibility/
  Keyboard focus order and screen reader announcements of radio button position in radio group and total of the radio group are incorrect.
  All 3 examples are affected. 

## A short description of the desired outcome or solution

  - Tab key should be used to focus radio group and move focus outside of radio group, inside radio group arrow keys should be used to move focus (select radio buttons)
  - The screen readers should announce correct position in radio group and total of the radio group, i.e. '1 of 2', '2 of 2'.
  

## Technical details

  The reason is that the 'name' attributes for radio buttons mismatch, 
  should be name="radio-ex" for both light radio buttons and name="radio-ex-dark" for both dark radio buttons.
