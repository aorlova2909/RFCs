# Separate components between React, jQuery and Vanilla

## The issue to be solved

We currently share a lot of code between the vanilla, jQuery and React components.
This has led to a bunch of issues including the fact that we're not using each framework to its fullest potential.

## A short description of the solution

I propose we create separate entry-points for each language and maintain a separation for the JavaScript used in each.
We should still re-use the same CSS though or aim to at least use the same token base (which isn't insufficiently separated yet either).

## Technical details
