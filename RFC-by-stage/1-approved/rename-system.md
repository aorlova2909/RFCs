## Rename design system

I propose that we rename "Australian Government Design System" to "GOLD Design System", where GOLD is an acronym for "Government Open Language for Design". I also propose we rename "Design System AU" to "Design System Au", where "u" in "Au" is lower case as that the atomic label representing the element gold. 

I propose that we do this as it was the original name of the system, as can be seen in this [CSS Tricks tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/css/status/970805659842134016) and the [original docs site](https://trevorbrennan.com/cv/gold). 

I believe this would be an appropriate identity change, in light of the end of an era of the DTA being the custodians.    

There is a counter argument for leaving the name as "Australian Government Design System" or "AuDS" because it is more clear, and people know what it is.  

However, both are authentic names for the system.

## A short description of the desired outcome or solution

This would require:  
* to update all references of "Australian Government Design System" to "GOLD Design System"
* to update of all references of "AuDS" to "GOLD"
* Other branding updates
* A Press Release or Blog post indicating this has occurred

This would **not** require: 
* Change to the npm handle or Github org, as the organisation would be the same
